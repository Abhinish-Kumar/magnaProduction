      <h3>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>These are the standard terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions") of the Magna Production Roadshow. These terms of business do not contain the entire agreement between us but compromise the principal terms under which we conduct our business. If we agree further terms, we will agree to these in writing.</li>
        <li>The Magna Production Roadshow will only be deemed to have entered into a contract upon payment of an agreed deposit in exchange for reservation of a defined service. The Magna Production Roadshow reserves the right to cancel Contracts without prejudice to full payment if full and final payment is not received within 7 days of the commencement of the event.</li>
        <li>The hirer may cancel the contract at any time after its issue in writing to the Magna Production Roadshow. For all cancellations, there will be a 15% admin fee charge, rising to a 100% cancellation fee should the contract be cancelled at any time within four weeks of the event for which services have been booked.</li>
        <li>In the event that the Magna Production Roadshow is unable to fulfil their obligation due to circumstances beyond their control, the Magna Production Roadshow will supply a replacement event provider of comparable industry standing, and the Magna Production Roadshow shall be released from all liability.</li>
        <li>Should the hirer turn down the replacement event provider, then the contract is void, and the Magna Production Roadshow will refund in full any payment taken towards the event.</li>
        <li>If a deposit has been paid to secure an external service provider on your behalf, the Magna Production Roadshow will refund the fee once received back from the external service provider, minus a 15% agency fee and fees incurred by the external service provider.</li>
        <li>In circumstances where an Event involves more than one separate attendance on a date and one of the dates is cancelled for the reasons set out in clauses 8-9 inclusive, or for any reason other than the fault of the Magna Production Roadshow or any external service providers booked through the Magna Production Roadshow, the whole event may be cancelled at the external event provider’s and the Magna Production Roadshow’s discretion. All sums due under this contract shall be payable by the hirer.</li>
        <li>The hirer agrees that it is their responsibility to ensure all taxes, either local or national, relating to the Event Provider's performance, are paid according to the law of the jurisdiction under which the event is scheduled. Under no circumstances is there to be a deduction from the Magna Production Roadshow’s fee in relation to this issue.</li>
        <li>All costs incurred by or on behalf of the Magna Production Roadshow, including but not limited to flights, hotels, and drivers required by the Magna Production Roadshow, are non-refundable under any circumstances. Should such costs be agreed as recoupable, the hirer is liable to pay such costs in full or their part of the agreed amount on or before 7 days prior to the event commencement date.</li>
        <li>All late or overdue payments will be referred to our debt collection agent and will be subject to a surcharge of 20% + VAT of the debt to cover the collection costs incurred. This surcharge, together with all other charges and legal fees incurred, will be the responsibility of the hirer and will be legally enforceable.</li>
        <li>Force Majeure: The Magna Production Roadshow and Artistes and event providers engaged by the Magna Production Roadshow for the fulfilment of your event will not be held responsible for non-attendance as a result of civil strikes, acts of God, or factors beyond the Magna Production Roadshow's control. In the case of illness, a doctor's certificate will be produced, and the hirer will take no action against the Magna Production Roadshow. In this circumstance, the deposit (less the admin fee) will be refunded to the hirer.</li>
        <li>The Magna Production Roadshow is only responsible for the placement of the contracted event services by a suitable event provider or artiste and excludes all liability for the performance of the same event provider and artiste during the engagement or breaches of the contract by the artiste or event provider. Changes and additions to the contract must be in writing and will be referred to as Riders. Should any part of this contract become void or challenged, the remainder remains unaffected.</li>
